 \section overview Overview
  
  The Make Controller firmware API provides a simple software interface to the Make Controller.  The main features
  include an \b OS (operating system), a full \b Ethernet system, a \b USB (virtual serial port) system, and many others.
  
  The \ref Core module provides the basic capabilities of the Controller and a variety of \ref Libraries provide
  additional functionality that can easily be added/removed based on the needs of a particular project.
  
  The \ref OSC module provides a reference for all the OSC commands that the Make Controller can respond to.

  To jump right into browsing the entire API, click on \b Modules above.  For general info, check the <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/documentation/tutorial/programming-the-make-controller-kit">

/** @defgroup Libraries Libraries
 Libraries that extend core functionality.
 Libraries are modules of code that can be easily added/removed based on the needs of a particular project.
 This is a list of libraries maintained by MakingThings, but you're free to create your own.  
 Just add a directory with your source files into the \b libraries directory of the firmware codebase.
 
 \section lib_in_project Incorporating a Library into your Project
 If you're using \b mcbuilder, just \b include the library you want to use.  
 
 If you're building from a Makefile, there are a few extra steps:
 - add the library directory to your list of include directories (along with any sub-directories if not all
 the include files are in a single directory).
 - add each .c file of the library to your list of files to compile
 
 In the Makefiles in the example projects in the firmware download, you can see the \b THUMB_SRC and 
 \b INCLUDEDIRS sections where you can add your own listings of both source files and include directories.

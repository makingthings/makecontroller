 \page Licenses Licenses
  Licenses for the use of Make Controller code.
  
  This page is really only relevant if you're planning on publicly releasing or selling code/programs that you create with the
  Make Controller.  The Make Controller software environment is a fusion of four main bodies of code:
	- User code: the applications that you create.
  - MakingThings library: code that MakingThings has contributed to make it easier to work with the Make Controller Kit.
	- FreeRTOS: an open source Real Time Operating System for the SAM7X.  See http://www.freertos.org
	- lwIP: a complete and open source TCIP/IP code library.  See http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/

	This software is all open source, and thus subject to the licensing of each module 
	of code.  All MakingThings specific code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, which is quite flexible for
	both open source and commercial projects.  Be sure to acquaint yourself with the licenses for the main 
	bodies of code in the Make Controller firmware codebase:
	- MakingThings: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html
	- FreeRTOS: http://www.freertos.org/a00114.html
	- lwIP: http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#5
